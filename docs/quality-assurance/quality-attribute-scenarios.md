## Performance Efficiency

### Resource utilization

Source: User trigger its system (computer or laptop)

Stimulus: User try to start the game on system with hardware

Artifact: Player (user) and system with some hardware

Environment: Production environment during starting the game

Response: If the device meets the minimum system requirements (Windows 10-11; CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3570; GPU: GeForce GTX 550 ti or Radeon hd 6570; RAM: 4 Gb; Disc space: 200 Mb), game will start correctly. Otherwise it may work slower.

Response Measure: Game startup time ≤ 15 seconds; CPU usage during startup ≤ 80% (on minimum spec); RAM usage during startup ≤ 3.5 GB; GPU usage during startup ≤ 90%; No system crashes or critical errors during startup

## Flexibility

### Installability

Source: Users want to install and uninstall our game on different OS

Stimulus: User want to (un)install our game on Windows, Linux, and MacOS using (un)install.exe

Artifact: Different install.exe and uninstall.exe for each OS

Enviroment: (Un)Installation enviroment

Response: Quick (un)installation in the same time regardless of OS Installation

Response Measure: Installation in less than 1 minute and uninstallation in less than 10 seconds regardless of OS

## Reliability

### Availability

Source:	itch.io page

Stimulus: User accesses the game page

Artifact: Web version of the game

Environment: itch.io environment during average usage period

Response: The page loads the web version of the game without significant delay

Response Measure: Game loading time is under 12 seconds without errors or loading failures
