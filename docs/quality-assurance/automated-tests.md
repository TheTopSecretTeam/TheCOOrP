### Automated tests

1. Resource utilization

In our case, there are no specific tests for this attribute. We took the minimum system requirements from Lobotomy Corporation and edited them, taking into account Steam and the output load of our laptops and computers.

2. Installability

We will load our game on different systems and calculate the time of (un)installation.

3. Availability

We will start our game on different systems and calculate the time of web version opening.
