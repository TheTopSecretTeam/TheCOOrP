### Git workflow

We have adopted the GitHub flow for our context.

Main steps:

1. Ð¡reate issues according to [templates](https://github.com/TheTopSecretTeam/TheCOOrP/tree/dev/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) and label it (type, size, SP, Milestone).

2. Any team member can assign issue to himself or anyone else

3. For each feature we create branch and name it as the feature itself. After the work, we merge it with dev branch.

4. Commits should be relevant and clear for all team members

5. After that we create a pull request according to [template](https://github.com/TheTopSecretTeam/TheCOOrP/tree/dev/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE).

6. Only privileged team members can review. Others can write comments for them or the author of this request.

7. After all these steps, issue can be closed.
