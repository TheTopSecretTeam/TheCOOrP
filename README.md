### Git workflow

We have adopted the GitHub flow for our context.

Main steps:

1. Ð¡reate issues according to templates and label it (type, size, SP, Milestone): https://github.com/TheTopSecretTeam/TheCOOrP/tree/dev/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE

2. Any team member can assign issue to himself or anyone else

3. For each feature we create branch and name it as the feature itself. After the work, we merge it with dev branch.

4. Commits should be relevant and clear for all team members

5. After that we create a pull request according to template: https://github.com/TheTopSecretTeam/TheCOOrP/tree/dev/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE

6. Only privileged team members can review. Others can write comments for them or the author of this request.

7. After all these steps, issue can be closed.

## Quality assurance

### Quality attribute scenarios

### Automated tests

1. Resource utilization

In our case, there are no specific tests for this attribute. We took the minimum system requirements from Lobotomy Corporation and edited them, taking into account Steam and the output load of our laptops and computers.

2. Installability

We will load our game on different systems and calculate the time of (un)installation.

3. Availability

We will start our game on different systems and calculate the time of web version opening.

### User acceptance tests

## Build and deployment

### Continuous Integration

According to our problems with linter that works with Godot (PS: it doesn`t work), we do not have CI pipeline.
